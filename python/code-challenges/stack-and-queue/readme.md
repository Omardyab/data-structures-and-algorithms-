# Queue, and Stack
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
I have created Stack and Queue using Pyhton. with 2 classes Queue, and Stack and one main Node

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
the idea is to maniuplate Queue, and Stack using different methods (eg for Stacks: push , pop )

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
as in the description its O(1) Time performance and space O(1)

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Stack and Queue-->
stack:
- push: add node
- pop: delete node
- is_empty: check if the stack is empty
- peek: viewing the value of the top Nod

queue:
- push: add node to rear
- pop: delete node from front
- is_empty: check if the queue is empty
- peek: viewing the value of the front
