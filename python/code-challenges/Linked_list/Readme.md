# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Linked List:is a special case of a tree.
1-Binary tree:max number of node is 2.
2-Unary tree:singly linked list
## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
its required to have a linked list and mainuplate it using different method (such as insert)
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
O(N) for all functions
## API
insert=> adds value in head
includes=> check if value exisited (in this case return false) otherwise return True
__str__ => Visual representation of the linked list bubbles
